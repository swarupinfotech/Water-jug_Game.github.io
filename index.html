                         your task is to put the liquids with same color together! You can transfer 
                         different colored water from one glass to another only if the other glass is empty
                          or its top most layer of water is of the same color as that of the one from which
                           water is to be taken. The glass you have selected will be highlighted to prevent
                            confusion. Restart button will take you back to the beginning of the level, also 
                            
                            every time you open the same level the water will be shuffled. Check out the real
                             game 'Water sort puzzle' on playstore, I have cloned it.</div>
